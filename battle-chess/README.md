# Battle Chess

A simple chess variant where captured pieces "battle" for a chance to return to the board!

## How to Play
- Standard chess rules for movement.
- When a piece is captured, there is a 50% chance it is truly captured, and a 50% chance it "wins the battle" and returns to a random empty square.
- First to capture the opponent's king wins.
- Click a piece to select, then click a destination square to move.
- Click "Restart" to start a new game.

## Features
- Playable in browser, mobile-friendly.
- Modern UI, no external libraries.
- Fun twist: every capture is a battle!
