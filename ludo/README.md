A simple web-based Ludo game for 2-4 players (pass-and-play, no AI).

## Game Guide & Rules

### Objective
Be the first player to move all four of your pieces from your starting area, around the board, and into your home column.

### Setup
- Each player chooses a color (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue) and gets 4 pieces.
- All pieces start in the player's base (corner area).

### Gameplay
1. Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, click "Roll Dice" to roll a six-sided die.
2. To move a piece out of your base onto the starting square, you must roll a 6. If you roll a 6, you may either move a piece out or move a piece already on the board 6 spaces. Rolling a 6 grants an extra turn.
3. Move your pieces clockwise around the board according to the dice roll.
4. If you land on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, that piece is sent back to its base.
5. Safe squares (usually marked) cannot be captured.
6. When a piece completes a full circuit, it enters the home column of its color. You must roll the exact number to move into the home space.
7. The first player to get all 4 pieces into their home wins.

### Controls
- Click "Roll Dice" to roll for your turn.
- Click on a piece to move it (if a move is possible).
- The game is pass-and-play: after your turn, the next player rolls.

### Notes
- This version is a simplified demo: some advanced rules and safe spots may not be fully implemented.
- No AI: all players are human (local multiplayer).
