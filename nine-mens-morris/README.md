# Nine Men's Morris

A simple web-based Nine Men's Morris game for 2 players (no AI).

## How to Play
- Each player has 9 pieces. Players take turns placing pieces on empty points.
- Phase 1: Place your pieces. If you form a mill (three in a row), remove an opponent's piece.
- Phase 2: Move your pieces to adjacent points. Forming a mill lets you remove an opponent's piece.
- Phase 3: When a player has only 3 pieces left, they can "fly" to any empty point.
- The game ends when a player is reduced to 2 pieces or cannot move. That player loses.
